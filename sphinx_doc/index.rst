Welcome to the documentation of autobasedoc
===========================================

autobasedoc is first a Toolbox based on *reportlab* and the platypus workflow therein, secondly it utilizes matplotlib to enable your workflow to insert your figures as vectorgraphic. The project aim is to improve the usability of the low level API of reportlab. It implements up to now only our main needs: matplotlib figures and an optional legend flowable.
